                with a scale factor of 15.6 mg/LSB (that is, 0x7F = 2 g). The

/**
Configure single/double tap detection.
@param tap_ena  Combination of axes enabled for tap detection.
@param thresh   The THRESH_TAP register is eight bits and holds the threshold
                value for tap interrupts. The data format is unsigned, therefore,
                the magnitude of the tap event is compared with the value
                in THRESH_TAP for normal tap detection. The scale factor is
                62.5 mg/LSB (that is, 0xFF = 16 g). A value of 0 may result in
                undesirable behavior if single tap/double tap interrupts are
                enabled.
@param dur      The DUR register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time
                value representing the maximum time that an event must be
                above the THRESH_TAP threshold to qualify as a tap event. The
                scale factor is 625 Âµs/LSB. A value of 0 disables the single tap/
                double tap functions,
@param latent   The latent register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time
                value representing the wait time from the detection of a tap
                event to the start of the time window (defined by the window
                register) during which a possible second tap event can be detected.
                The scale factor is 1.25 ms/LSB. A value of 0 disables the double tap
                function.
@param window   The window register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time
                value representing the amount of time after the expiration of the
                latency time (determined by the latent register) during which a
                second valid tap can begin. The scale factor is 1.25 ms/LSB. A
                value of 0 disables the double tap function.
@param suppress Setting the suppress bit suppresses double tap detection if
                acceleration greater than the value in THRESH_TAP is present
                between taps.

/**
Configure activity/inactivity detection.
@param ac_dc    In dc-coupled operation, the current acceleration magnitude is
                compared directly with THRESH_ACT and THRESH_INACT to determine
                whether activity or inactivity is detected. In ac-coupled operation
                for activity detection, the acceleration value at the start of
                activity detection is taken as a reference value. New samples of
                acceleration are then compared to this reference value, and if the
                magnitude of the difference exceeds the THRESH_ACT value, the device
                triggers an activity interrupt.
                Similarly, in ac-coupled operation for inactivity detection, a
                reference value is used for comparison and is updated whenever
                the device exceeds the inactivity threshold. After the reference
                value is selected, the device compares the magnitude of the
                difference between the reference value and the current acceleration
                with THRESH_INACT. If the difference is less than the value in
                THRESH_INACT for the time in TIME_INACT, the device is
                considered inactive and the inactivity interrupt is triggered.
@param act_ena  Combination of axes enabled for activity triggering.
@param inact_ena  Combination of axes enabled for activity triggering.
@param thr_act  The THRESH_ACT register is eight bits and holds the threshold value for
                detecting activity. The data format is unsigned, so the magnitude of the
                activity event is compared with the value in the THRESH_ACT register.
                The scale factor is 62.5 mg/LSB. A value of 0 may result in undesirable
                behavior if the activity interrupt is enabled.
@param thr_inact  The THRESH_INACT register is eight bits and holds the threshold value
                for detecting inactivity. The data format is unsigned, so the magnitude of
                the inactivity event is compared with the value in the THRESH_INACT register.
                The scale factor is 62.5 mg/LSB. A value of 0 may result in undesirable
                behavior if the inactivity interrupt is enabled.
@param time_inact  The TIME_INACT register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time value
                representing the amount of time that acceleration must be less than the value
                in the THRESH_INACT register for inactivity to be declared. The scale factor
                is 1 sec/LSB. Unlike the other interrupt functions, which use unfiltered data
                (see the Threshold section), the inactivity function uses filtered output data.
                At least one output sample must be generated for the inactivity interrupt to
                be triggered. This results in the function appearing unresponsive if the
                TIME_INACT register is set to a value less than the time constant of the output
                data rate. A value of 0 results in an interrupt when the output data is less
                than the value in the THRESH_INACT register.
